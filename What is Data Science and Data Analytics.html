          <h3>What is Data Science and Data Analytics?</h3>
          <img src="images/Blog-2.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            <strong>Data Science</strong> is a field that encompasses related to
            data cleansing, preparation, and analysis. Data science is an
            umbrella term in which many scientific methods apply. For example
            mathematics, statistics, and many other tools scientists apply to
            data sets. Scientist applies the tools to extract knowledge from
            data.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is a tool to tackle <strong>Big Data</strong>. And then extract
            information from it. First Data scientist gathers data sets from
            multi disciplines and compiles it. After that, apply
            <strong>machine learning</strong>, predictive and sentimental
            analysis. Then sharpen it to a point where he can derive something.
            At last, he extracts the useful information from it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Data scientist understands data from a business point of view. His
            work is to give the most accurate prediction. He takes charge of
            giving his predictions. The prediction of data scientist is very
            accurate. It prevents a businessman from future loss.
          </p>
          <p>
            In <strong>artificial intelligence and machine learning</strong>,
            Data scientist has a great role to play. For Data scientist,
            knowledge of machine learning is the must. Machine learning is the
            most impressive development in the tech world. He requires knowing
            that which method of machine learning will exactly help him. And
            finally, how to apply that. He does not need to know how that method
            works.

            <ul>
              <li>
                In-depth knowledge of Python coding. It is the most common
                language including Perl, Ruby etc.
              </li>
              <li>Sound knowledge of SAS/R</li>
              <li>
                Data Scientist should have a good understanding of various
                analytical functions. For example rank, median etc
              </li>
              <li>In depth knowledge of Machine learning requires.</li>
              <li>
                A Data scientist should familiar with Hive, mahout, Bayesian
                networks, etc. In data science, knowledge of MySQL is just like
                an added advantage.

          <h4>What is Data Analytics?</h4>
          <div>
            <p>
              Most people think that data science and data analytics are
              similar. But there is a minute difference between them. Data
              analytics is the basic level of data science. In data analytics
              computations made by using SAS/R. They mostly have business and
              computer science degree.
            </p>
            <p>
              Its methodologies are mainly used in commercial industries.It is
              the science of drawing insights from sources of raw information.
              It discloses the trends and metrics. Otherwise, data may lose in
              the mass of information. They use the information to increase the
              efficiency of a business system.
            </p>
            <p>
              To verify and disprove existing theories or models, Data Analytics
              is used. It is also used in many industries to enable
              organizations to make better decisions.
